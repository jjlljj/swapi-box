# SwapiBox

In this project for Turing's Front End Engineering program, I was asked to create a React App using data from the Star Wars API (SWApi). I chose to implement Router for the storage to handle page navigation, and all the deeply nested asynchronous API calls required to pull the data for display were thoroughly tested with Enzyme and Jest.

## Project Goals

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* propTypes validation for all props passed to components.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests with complete coverage for all components and functionality of application.
